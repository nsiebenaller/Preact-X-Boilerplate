# Preact-X-Boilerplate
Minimal Preact X Boilerplate

Preact-CLI is still working on upgrading it's tooling to Preact-X, so I needed a boilerplate to work off of. 
In addition, the exposed webpack config is a useful jumping off point into new projects.

# Steps
1. Clone Repo
2. Navigate into root of project
3. Run `npm i`
4. Run `npm run start`
5. Profit???
